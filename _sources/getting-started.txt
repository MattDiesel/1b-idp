Getting started
===============

A guide for the electronics and mechanics team, when they need to test.

First of all, you'll want to get a copy of the code. We're using git for version control, so you can get that like this on the command line::

	$ cd ~/idp_shared/<yourcrsid>
	$ git clone ~/idp_shared/Common/repo.git
	Initialized empty Git repository in /groups/IB/idp/idp-l205/efw27/repo/.git/
	$ cd repo

After you've done this once, you should type the following every time the software team change the code::

    $ cd ~/idp_shared/<yourcrsid>/repo
    $ git pull


Useful programs
------------

The following launches a keyboard interface for remote controlling the robot. Upon startup, it describes the key-mapping::

	$ ./test t_remote

To test the competition code, use::

	$ ./test t_all

Which allows you to enter the main routine at any point in the sequence

When things go wrong
--------------------

You'll get errors if things aren't working. A common one is::

	terminate called after throwing an instance of 'LinkError'
	  what():  Host not found on network
	./test: line 1: 22780 Aborted                 tests/$1.wifi

If this occurs, the robot is probably not yet powered. Wait for the blue LED. If all fails, pull the plug on it and try again.

Another one is::

	terminate called after throwing an instance of 'PortError'
	  what():  Port P1 disconnected.
	./test: line 1: 22780 Aborted                 tests/$1.wifi

Which indicates a missing or broken electronics board. You can debug further with::

	$ ./test t_conns
	constructed
	initialized
	Testing P1... Connected
	Testing P2... Connected
	Testing P3... Disconnected

If all fails, then the controller itself probably needs its power taken away.


**TL;DR:** turn it off and on again


Building the docs
-----------------

This documentation is autogenerated. Building it is slightly involved, and won't work on the department computers. It requires python and doxygen::

	$ pip install breathe sphinx_rtd_theme   # first time only
	$ cd docs
	$ doxygen
	$ make html  # or make.bat html on windows

The docs will be placed in ``docs/_build/html``.
