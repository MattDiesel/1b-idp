1B Integrated Design Project Team L205

This is the work down by Team FedEggs (L205) during lent term of 2015. The integrated design project is the big second year project, that takes place over the period of a month. The task is to construct a robot that moves around a track in order to collect and deliver eggs dependant on their colour. 

The problem statement can be found [here](http://www3.eng.cam.ac.uk/DesignOffice/idp/resources/current/problem_statements.pdf). Documentation for the source code can be found [here](http://1b-idp.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html).

Videos of the robot in action can be found on youtube, by searching for FedEggs. Some choice videos are:

The robot had a poor run on the day but still achieved second place.
